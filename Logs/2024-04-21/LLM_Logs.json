She bundles her cutting-edge research in the profile lines Light \u2013 Life \u2013 Liberty. It is closely networked with non-university research institutions, research-based companies and well-known cultural institutions. With almost 18,000 students and more than 8,600 employees, the university significantly shapes Jena's character as a cosmopolitan and future-oriented city.\n%Query\nHow many students are there in Friedrich Schiller University Jena?\n"]}, "output": "%ANSWER:\nThere are almost 18,000 students in Friedrich Schiller University Jena."}
